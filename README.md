## US Median House Price Prediction: A Time Series Analysis

In this repository, we delve deep into the historical data of US median house prices to forecast their trajectory for the next six years (2023-2029). 
Leveraging advanced time series analysis techniques, our goal is to identify patterns, trends, and factors influencing these prices to provide a robust forecast.

**Features:**

- Detailed data preprocessing and exploratory analysis to understand underlying patterns.
- Application of various time series models including:
  * ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)
  * Exponential Smoothing
  * Benchmark Models
  * TSLM (Time Series Linear Models)
  * ETS (Error, Trend, Seasonality model)
- Comprehensive model evaluation to identify the best performing model.

Based on our thorough analysis, the ETS model was singled out as the most suitable for predicting the median house prices in the US for the forthcoming period.
